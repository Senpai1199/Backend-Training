# Rules for Submitting your Assignments
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account and from there clone it to your local machine.
2. Switch into the branch with your name on it (using git checkout --track origin/<name_here>) locally and then begin writing your code in your designated folder. Good commit messages are appreciated.
3. After finishing your assignment, push your code back to the corresponding <name_here> branch on your fork, then from there create a fairly well written pull request back to this original repository.
4. If and when the pull request gets accepted... celebrate! It means that you learnt something new well enough to apply it.
5. Keep learning, and if you want to, further improve your submission with another pull request.

__Note__: code following PEP8 is appreciated though is by no means a requirement. PEP8 isn't for everyone.
