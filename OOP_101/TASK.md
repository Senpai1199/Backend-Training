# OOP 101

### Aim
Apply the _basics_ of object-oriented programming in python to a simple task. By the end of this task you would have gained hands-on experience to all of the basic OOP that you have learnt or will learn while doing this task.

##### Keywords
  - Classes and Instances (General OOP)
  - Inheritance (General OOP)
  - Composition (General OOP)
  - Encapsulation (General OOP)
  - Polymorphism (General OOP)
  - magic methods (Python)
    (e.g. \__init__(self) -- Python's way of defining constructors)
  - The _super_ and _self_ keywords

##### Recommended Reading
  - "Learning Python" _(5th edition)_ by Mark Lutz: Part VI "Classes and OOP"
  - "Learn Python the Hard Way" _(3rd edition)_ by Zed Shaw: Exercises 41-45

### Task
Using as many concepts provided in the keywords as you can (without having to go too far out of your way) implement either a game, tool, system, or etc. This task is recommended to be a simple CLI-based application/program as it's only to practice OOP, but you're free to make a full blown application if you _really_ want to. Though it would make better sense to extend this application with a GUI and a database once you learn Django.

##### Criteria for Evalution
Just to be clear, we won't actually be grading you, that would be repulsive. These are just some things that we'll be keeping in mind when we look at your submission.
With that in mind, here are the criteria:
  - Creativity and Ability to recognize real-life use cases of programming (via. python) and more specifically OOP.
  - The degree to which OOP is used.
  - Cleanliness of code and use of comments (over-use and under-use are both frowned upon).
  - Quality of application of OOP (for the right reasons in the right way).
  - Pythonic code.

##### Time Alloted
  - Assigned on: September 1st, 2018
  - Due by: September 10th, 2018 (worst case by the 11th)

##### Submission Rules
  - See CONTRIBUTING.md

__Good Luck and Have Fun__
